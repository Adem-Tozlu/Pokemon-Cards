# Project – Pokemon Cards


This is a solution to a challenge at the DCI (Digital Career Institute). The challenges will help you improve your programming skills by creating realistic projects. I am happy to report on the Pokemon Cards project. As part of the "Pokemon Cards" project, a Pokemon card was successfully displayed using data from the Pokemon API. In addition to displaying the card data, the sound of the respective Pokemon was also integrated to make the experience even more interactive and lively. It is It is important that the names of the Pokemon are always given in English when searching to ensure a correct search in the Pokemon API.

### What I have learned


During the course of this project, I was able to significantly expand my skills in the following areas:

  CSS: Through intensive engagement with the design possibilities of CSS, I have considerably deepened my knowledge and skills in this area.

  Javascript: The active application of Javascript in the project has given me valuable experience in dealing with this programming language.

  APIs: By integrating APIs into the project, I have gained practical knowledge in using interfaces for data transmission and processing.

   DOM: Working with the DOM (Document Object Model) has improved my understanding of the structure and functionality of HTML-based web pages.

In summary, it can be said that this project has made an important contribution to my professional development.


### Further development

In the future, I plan to improve my CSS and Javascript skills. My goal is to create more complex websites and design them better.
